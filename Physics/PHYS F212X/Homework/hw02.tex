    \subsection*{Con. Questions}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item [8.]
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item [a.] \mbox{}
            \begin{mdframed}
                Given the ideal gas law of $PV = nRT$, as the volume decreases, the pressure will increase but the temperature will remain the same. Given that the vapor is at $-0.01^{\circ}$C and the pressure is so miniscule, the gas will eventually turn into ice and as the pressure increases, it will turn into water as it passes the melting point.
            \end{mdframed}

            \item[b.] \mbox{}
            \begin{mdframed}
                If the temperature starts at $0.02^{\circ}$C, then the vapor will never turn to ice; it will condense into water directly as the pressure passes the condensation line.
            \end{mdframed}
        \end{itemize}
        \item [12.] \mbox{}
        
        \begin{mdframed}
            Their $C$ line is linear, yet isothermal processes occur as a multiplicative function of pressure and volume. The $C$ line should be curved outwards from the inside of the triangle.
        \end{mdframed}
