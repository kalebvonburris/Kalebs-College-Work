        The normal force is larger than $mg$ because the hand is inputting an addition force, say $f_{h}$, that would generate a normal force of $fg + f_{h}$

            \item Since the mass is doubled, and $F=ma$, the acceleration is halved. According to $v_{f} = v_{0}t + at$, with a $v_{f} = 0$, time to stop must at least be doubled. Therefore, the distance $d$ must also be doubled.
            
            \item If the initial velocity is doubled, the time to slow down to $v = 0$ will also be doubled, thus the block will travel twice the distance.
        \end{enumerate}

        The friction points south, away from the direction the crate is accelerating. This is because it's acting as a normal force to the acceleration of the crate, and thus must point opposite to the direction it's accelerating in.

            \item 
            \item $F_{s} = 10(9.8)(0.5) = 49 N$. Thus, a force > $49 N$ is needed. Rearranging, $49 = 10(a)(0.5) \Rightarrow a = $
