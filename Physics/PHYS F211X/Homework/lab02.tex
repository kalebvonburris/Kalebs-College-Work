    \section*{Part 1: Speeding Up}

    \paragraph*{1.}

    \begin{mdframed}
        \begin{equation}
            \vec{a} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{v}}{\mathrm{d}t}
        \end{equation}

        Acceleration is the derivative of velocity; it describes the rate of change of the velocity.

        \begin{equation}
            \sum\vec{F} = m\vec{a}
        \end{equation}

        Forces are a sum or integral of the mass and acceleration applied to something.

    \paragraph*{4.}

    \begin{mdframed}
        If the initial mass is doubled, the acceleration will be doubled, making the velocity increase at twice the rate and resulting in the cart traveling the same distance in $\sim\sfrac{1}{4}$ the time.

    \section*{Part 2: Slowing Down}

    \paragraph*{6.}

    \begin{mdframed}
        The acceleration would be negative because the cart will decelerate to a stop, with the vector of the deceleration being pointed toward the sensor.

        The lighter lines are the ``no-friction'' experiment.

        \subparagraph*{8.}
        For force, there seems to be little to no difference - although this may have been because of the inaccuracy of the recording device.

        \subparagraph*{9.}
        For velocity, there seems to be a slight advantage for the no-friction experiment which grows a small amount as it approaches the end.

        For acceleration, there seems to be a very slight advantage for the no-friction experiment.

    \paragraph*{14., 15.}

    \begin{mdframed}
        {\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{image14}}

        At a steeper slope, the acceleration was higher which resulted in the velocity and position having steeper slopes, this resulted in reaching the end of the ramp in $\sim\sfrac{2}{3}$ the time of the shallower slope.

    \section*{Conclusion Questions}

    \paragraph*{21.}

    \begin{mdframed}
        Motion away is represented as a positive value. Speeding up is signified by a positive/negative slope to the velocity graph.
    \end{mdframed}

    \paragraph*{22.}

    \begin{mdframed}
        The magnitude of the acceleration is the absolute value of the slope of the plot.
    \end{mdframed}

    \paragraph*{23.}

    \begin{mdframed}
        The magnitude of the acceleration is represented as the absolute value of the acceleration vs time graph.
    \end{mdframed}

    \paragraph*{24.}

    \begin{mdframed}
        The sign of the velocity is positive and the sign of the acceleration is negative because the cart is moving in the positive direction but accelerating in the negative direction.
    \end{mdframed}

    \paragraph*{25.}

    \begin{mdframed}
        The force is relatively even but does have a slight peak towards the end of the ramp, probably due to the stopping of the cart.
    \end{mdframed}

    \paragraph*{26.}

    \begin{mdframed}
        The force does not change with or without the friction pad, but the acceleration does. This is not a violation because there is an extra force being applied to the cart that isn't being detected by the probe - friction - that forces either the mass of the object or the acceleration to change according to $\sum F = m\vec{a}$ as the net force changes on the cart.
    \end{mdframed}

    \paragraph*{27.}

    \begin{mdframed}
        The velocity shoots to a negative value and then returns on a linear path to a positive one; the acceleration shoots sharply down and then returns up to a positive constant. My graphs were pretty close but failed to capture the start-up of the velocity graph and the extra peaks/troughs of the acceleration graph.
    \end{mdframed}

    \paragraph*{28.}

    \begin{mdframed}
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
            \item The average velocity on the way up is positive.
            \item The acceleration on the way up is negative.
            \item At the top, the velocity is zero.
            \item At the top the acceleration is negative.
            \item The velocity on the way down is negative.
            \item The acceleration on the way down is negative.
            \item When the ball's velocity and acceleration have opposite signs the ball is \underline{going up} and when the velocity and acceleration have the same sign the ball is \underline{falling down}.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{mdframed}

    \paragraph*{29.}

    \begin{mdframed}
        When the friction pad is down, it applies a force that will constantly affect the acceleration, especially while the cart is rolling down the ramp.
