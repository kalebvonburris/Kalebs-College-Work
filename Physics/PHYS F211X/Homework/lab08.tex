        The ball won the race.

        \item[8.]
        
        Yes, I believe the low surface contact between the ball and the ramp led to lower energy loss to friction, it also had a higher mass but a similar radius to the others, meaning its initial potential energy was higher, and it had the highest theoretical inertia.

        \item[14.]
        
        Terribly. The calculated moments of inertia were about 7 orders of magnitude smaller, for the case of the ball, it was $\frac{1400.71}{0.00073} = 1,918,781$ times larger in the experimental case. I have no idea what we did in our calculations for this to happen, but it is astronomically wrong.

        \item[15.]
        
        I'm almost certain our equations were not set up correctly. On top of that, the obvious things like friction, vibration, and inaccuracy in where we dropped the objects, are all also factors in the uncertainty.

        Center - Kaleb

        \item [18.]
        
        If the wheels are lighter, it'll take less energy to move them, meaning you have to spend less energy accelerating/decelerating.

        \item [19.]
        
        The slower the discus spins, the less rotational acceleration will occur, which will pull the discus back and forth, reducing its overall horizontal speed.

        \item [20.]
        
        I don't know what a moment of inertia stick is, we didn't engage with them.
