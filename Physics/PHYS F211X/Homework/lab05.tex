    I was pretty sick when I filled in this lab. Forgive the terrible formatting and cheapskate images.

    \paragraph*{1.}

    \begin{equation*}
        E = K + U
    \end{equation*}

    Mechanical energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy in a system, so changing one will have a linear effect on the other.

    \begin{equation*}
        U = \frac{1}{2}(k_{1})(x-x_{e})^{2} + U_{0}
    \end{equation*}

    For springs, the potential energy is half of the spring constant times the displacement squared plus any initial potential energy.

    \begin{equation*}
        K = \frac{1}{2}\left[M + \frac{1}{3}(m_{1} + m_{2})\right]v^{2}
    \end{equation*}

    Kinetic energy is based on the mass of the system and the velocity squared.

    The spring constant is the negative of the slope (from question 2).
 	$k$ = 7.965 N/m

    E = A*exp(-C*t)+B
    A: 0.1575
    C: 0.09993

    A is the initial energy 

    B is final energy in the system

    C is energy loss due to friction

    Logger pro says the RMSE  is $\pm$ 0.07085 N. Given just how shaky my hands were, this uncertainty seems pretty low, although the algorithm for RMSE is relatively good at filtering outliers.

    \section*{Conclusions}

    \paragraph*{1.}

    The restoring force is in the opposite direction the spring is being stretched in. When you stretch the spring in the negative direction (compress it), the restoring force is much the same; in the opposite direction you're applying force to.

    \paragraph*{2.}

    Yes, the derivative of a sinusoidal graph is a cosinusoidal graph, meaning it's 90 degrees out of sync. Both graphs were 90 degrees out of sync with each other.

    \paragraph*{3.}

    The max amplitude of the $U$ plot was much large than the $K$ plot, however it functioned to be 90 degrees out of sync of the $K$ plot, following $E = K + U$ correctly.

    \paragraph*{4.}

    Over time they slowly lose amplitude, which is most likely cause by outside forces like friction and air resistance.

    \paragraph*{5.}

    The mechanical energy here is being leeched out of the system as stated before.

    \paragraph*{6.}

    1: Energy lost as heat via friction, 2: Energy lost to the force of air resistance, 3: energy lost to vibrations in the springs, 4: Energy lost as it's imparted into the springs and down and out of the glider.

    \paragraph*{7.}

    The $K$ recording was much lower than the $U$ recording. This is most likely due to inaccuracies in the sensor, issues in the software interpolating the points of data collected, kinetic energy being leeched from the system, and probably due to some unfamiliarity we had with the equipment and experiment. It took us about 10 minutes to figure out that rotating the motion sensor would fix the occurance of massive erroneous blips in the data.
