    \section*{Station 1: Elastic Band}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item [2.] The heavier/thicker the band, the deeper the pitch.
        \item [3.] When plucked at different distances, the black band resonated at shorter amplitudes.
        \item [4.] Tension used: 13 N.
        
        Heavy band: Deep pitch and loud.

        Medium band: High pitch and loud.

        Small band: High pitch and quiet.
    \end{itemize}

    \section*{Station 2: Air Column}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item [6.] I can hear a low pitch and high pitch frequency. Higher forces result in more audible high frequencies, and vice versa. The longer the pipe, the longer the noise lasted.
        \item [7.] Similar lengths but different diameters sounded almost identical, but the smaller diameter sounds slightly higher pitched.
        \item [8.] There is effectively no resonant sound generated with the plunger in.
        \item [9.] The steeper the angle to the nozzle, the higher the pitch and the louder the noise.
        
        {\centering\includegraphics{image2.png}}

        \item [10.] The further the plunger was, the louder and higher pitched the noise.
    \end{itemize}

    \section*{Station 3: Mass on a string}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item [11.]
        
        Easiest to stretch: Shortest spring

        Mediumist to stretch: Long single spring

        Most difficult to stretch: Double spring

        \item [12.]
        
        Lightest: 10 g

        Mediumest: 20 g

        Heaviest: 50 g

        \item [13.] No, it will oscillate slower because most of the kinetic energy that would have been gained from starting higher is not in the system.
        \item [14.] The heaviest weight with the easiest to stretch spring will oscillate the slowest.
        \item [15.] The lightest weight with the hardest to stretch spring will oscillate the fastest.
        \item [16.] \mbox{}\\
