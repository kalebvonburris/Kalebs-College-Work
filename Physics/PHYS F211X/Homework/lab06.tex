    \section*{Part 1}

    \paragraph*{1.}
    \begin{equation}
        \vec{p} = m\vec{v}
    \end{equation}

    Momentum is derived as the mass of an object times its velocity.

    \begin{equation}
        \vec{F_{net}} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}
    \end{equation}

    The net force of a system is the rate of change of the momentum.

    \begin{equation}
        \vec{p_{i}} = m_{1}\vec{v_{1f}} + m_{2}\vec{v_{2f}}
    \end{equation}

    The total momentum of a system where an elastic collision occurs is the sum of the masses times their velocities, both at the beginning and at the end.

    \paragraph*{2.}
    The small glider will move back in the direction it came and the large glider will travel with a smaller magnitude to the right than the mall glider initially had.

    \paragraph*{3.}
    The experiment mimicked what I guessed would happen.

    \paragraph*{5.}

    The larger glider had a larger velocity after the collision.

    \paragraph*{6.}

    The smaller glider has a much larger velocity after the collision than the larger glider.

    \paragraph*{7.}

    The gliders will stick together and travel at a reduced velocity.

    \paragraph*{8.}

    The results were as predicted, although the nature of the tape caused some strange behavior between the carts on impact.

    Larger cart: 0.7321 kg

    Smaller cart: 0.5223 kg

    \paragraph*{11.}\mbox{}

    Momentum was conserved as the total P was not noticeably reduced after the collision.

    \paragraph*{12., 13., 14.}

    {\centering\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{image13.png}}

    The total P after the collision was the negative of the total initial momentum, with a relatively small margin of error.

    \paragraph*{15.}

    \paragraph*{16.}\mbox{}\\

    Initial: -0.3058m/s * 0.5223kg = -0.1597 (kg*m)/s
    
    Final: 0.113m/s*0.5223kg = 0.0590 (kg*m)/s

    0.0590 - -0.1597 = 0.2187 N*s

    \paragraph*{17.}

    Integral for: Latest | Force
    
    Integral: 0.2213 N*s

    \paragraph*{18.}

    In order for momentum to be conserved, there must be no way the system can leak energy out of itself, such as through air resistance or friction.

    \paragraph*{19.}

    The force itself on the carts was the same, although because of the difference in mass, both carts were left with a final velocity that was different in magnitude from each other.

    \paragraph*{20.}

    No, momentum was not conserved as the magnitude of both momentums after the collision were both lower than the momentum before the collision, thus a leak of energy occurred and the system did not conserve its momentum.

    \paragraph*{21.}

    The mass of the carts, the inaccuracy of the sensor, and the several external forces such as air resistance all act as sources of uncertainty.

    \paragraph*{22.}

    The force between the cart and the force probe was the same.

    \paragraph*{23.}

    The $\Delta p$ was 0.3\%. Because of the stability of the data measurements and sheer volume of data it's working on, the one derived from force.
