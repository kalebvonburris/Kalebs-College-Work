        \item[2.]
        A sample of asking prices for 2BR/2BA houses in two large U.S. cities were collected. Let $\overline{X_{n}}$ and $\overline{Y_{m}}$ be the sample average asking prices for the two cities. All prices are assumed to be independent, within cities and between cities. Let $\mu_{X}$ = 268 and $\mu_{Y}$ = 260 be the average values for the individual houses in the two cities (units are thousands of dollars), and let $\sigma_{X}$ = 22 and $\sigma_{Y}$ = 20 be the standard deviations (also in thousands of dollars).

        \begin{itemize}
            \item [(a)]
            Find the expected value and the variance of $\overline{X_{n}}$ - $\overline{Y_{m}}$. (Note that the sample sizes, n and m, need not be equal. (Your answer will have both n and m in it.)

                \begin{align*}
                    \mathbb{E}(\overline{X}_{n} - \overline{Y}_{m})
                        & = \mathbb{E}(\overline{X}_{n}) - \mathbb{E}(\overline{Y}_{m}) \\
                        & = 268 - 260 = \boxed{8}                                       \\
                    \text{var}(\overline{X}_{n} - \overline{Y}_{m})
                        & = \text{var}(\overline{X}_{n})/n+(-1)^{2}\text{var}(\overline{Y}_{m})/m\\
                        & = \boxed{\frac{22}{n} + \frac{20}{m}}
                \end{align*}
            \end{mdframed}

            \item [(b)]
            If asking prices are normally distributed and the samples are of sizes n = 10 and m = 12, is there enough information to calculate $P(-0.2 \leq \overline{X}_{n} - \overline{Y}_{m} - 7.0 \leq 0.2)$? Why or why not? If yes, estimate the value.
            \\
            \begin{mdframed}
                \begin{align*}
                    \overline{X}_{10} - \overline{Y}_{12} \sim N\left(8,\frac{22}{10} 
                    + \frac{20}{12}\right) & \approx N(8, 0.1887)                       \\
                    P(-0.2 \leq \overline{X}_{n} - \overline{Y}_{m} - 7.0 \leq 0.2)
                        & = P()
                \end{align*}

            \item [(c)]
            If the distribution of the asking prices is unknown, and the samples are of sizes n = 36 and m = 25, is there enough information to calculate $P(-0.2 \leq \overline{X}_{n} - \overline{Y}_{m} - 7.0 \leq 0.2)$? Why or why not? If yes, estimate the value.

            \item [(d)]
            If the distribution of the asking prices is unknown (not necessarily normal), and the samples are of sizes n = 36 and m = 49, is there enough information to calculate $P(-0.2 \leq \overline{X}_{n} - \overline{Y}_{m} - 7.0 \leq 0.2)$? Why or why not? If yes, estimate the value.

        Let $X_{1}, \cdots, X_{n}$ be independent Exponential($\theta$) random variables.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item [(a)]
            Show that $\overline{X}$ is biased for $\theta$.
